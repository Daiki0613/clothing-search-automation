## Getting Started

`npm install` to install all dependencies.

`npm run dev` to start the server.

`npm run build` to build the project, and then `npm start` to start the server.

## Proof of Concept

Given a user-supplied image, the application will return the most similar clothing item from the image using a pre-trained model. State-of-the-art browser AI agents are used to enforce deterministic outputs and realistic results.
